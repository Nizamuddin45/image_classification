Instead of learning a complete transformation, the network learns a residual function, which makes optimization easier. These connections allow gradients to flow directly during backpropagation, reducing the vanishing gradient problem. As a result, ResNet can successfully train very deep convolutional neural networks and achieve better performance and faster convergence compared to plain CNNs.\n",
